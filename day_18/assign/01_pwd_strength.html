    <title>Password Strength</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p>Create an HTML page that contains a password field. As the user types,
      indicate the strength of their password (weak, strong, etc.),
      following the rules below.</p>

      <p>A password is considered strong when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It has more than 8 characters</li>
        <li>It has at least one lower case character</li>
        <li>It has at least one upper case character</li>
        <li>It has at least one non alphanumeric character</li>
        <li>It has more than 12 characters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these criteria gives the password 1 point. A password is considered:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>0 points: terrible</li>
        <li>1 points: weak</li>
        <li>2 points: meh meh</li>
        <li>3 points: good</li>
        <li>4 points: strong</li>
        <li>5 points: awesome!</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>
      <p>Mark a password as terrible if it's included in a blacklist.
      E.g.: password, 123456, 12345678, admin, master, 111111, etc.
      Maybe even have a witty comment show up, like "Are you kidding me?"</p>

      <p>Add a toggle (checkbox) to display the password (change the field
      to type=text and populate it with the current value).
      Unchecking the toggle switches it back to type=password</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="pwd">Password: </label>
      <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" placeholder="Type your password">
      <button type="button" id="show" name="show">Show Password</input>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p id="rating"></p>
      <p id="suggestion"></p>      
    </div>
